Cleaned up the code and tried to make it more modular with separate components and prefabs for
chat, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text

As of 01/28/2020 7PM CDT time zone, this Unity Project works with Unity 2017.2.8f1, IBM Unity SDK 4.1.1, and Unity SDK core 1.2.0. I'm pretty sure it will work with IBM Unity SDK 4.3.0. You just need to delete the unity-sdk-4.1.1 folder and replace it with unity-sdk-4.3.0. I fixed the mistake of not using the Watson service URLs correctly. So, it should now work with different IBM cloud regions. I've only tried it using the Dallas, Washington DC, and London regions. The video clips and pics for the instructions in this README file still need to be updated, but I did modify the text to explain what needs to be done to set this up.
